Recommended build order (practical)
	1	Team Pass Attempts (NB GLM) → foundation
	2	QB Attempts (split), QB Passing Yards (Gamma + offset)
	3	Player Targets (share of team attempts or NB GLMM with offset)
	4	Player Receptions (Binomial | targets)
	5	Player Receiving Yards (Gamma + offset = log targets)
	6	Team Rush Attempts (derived), then Player Rush Attempts (share / NB GLMM)
	7	Player Rushing Yards (Gamma + offset = log rush att)
	8	QB INTs/Pass TDs (optional mid-way)
	9	Anytime TDs (after usage is modeled)
	10	Longest Plays (last; needs player efficiency/air-yards features)
This order keeps everything non-circular, gets you to useful projections fast, and each step supplies inputs for the next.

TARGET PROJECTIONS:
1. Touchdowns (anytime) 
2. Passing Yards 
3. Pass Attempts 
4. Passing Completions 
5. Ints thrown 
6. Passing TDs thrown 
7. Receiving yards 
8. Receptions 
9. Rushing Yards 
10. Rushing Attempts 
11. Longest Rush 
12. Longest Reception


Team level stats that might be used to project values without incurring circular reasoning (all EWMA):
1. Team Pass Rate
2. Team Rush Rate
3. Total Team Plays
4. O/U
5. Spread
6. Opponent Rank
6.b Opponent Average yards allowed
6.c Opponent Avg pass yards allowed
6.d Opponeent Avg rush yards allowed
